        I am a programmer, currently currently enrolled at the technical college <a href="http://www.spengergasse.at" target="_blank" class="link">HTBLVA Spengergasse</a>, where I am taking bilingual IT classes. I am continuously aiming to improve myself in programming since I was 11, and have found my passion in software engineering and game development. I am currently using the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4" target="_blank" class="link">Unreal Engine</a> for Game Development. My projects can be viewed in my <a href="javascript:loadPortfolio();" class="link">portfolio</a>.
        <br>
        <br> My interest in technology sparked a few years ago, and my knowledge around desktop hardware and peripherals has grown ever since. I am adapting fast to the surrounding professional enviroment, while trying to contribute to its improvement.
